# IKCorrective

Created in MAYA to correct the multi axis rotation of elbow and knee joints during motion capture data matching in FK mode, resulting in distortion and jumping of joint modifications

Using the principle of IK joints, convert the multi axis rotation values at the elbow into single axis rotation, and always maintain single axis rotation to ensure that the modified shape of the elbow and other parts is maintained
